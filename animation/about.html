<h1 class="abouttitle"> Shapes in Motion</h1>
<p class="abouttext">
This website explores the Suprematist Artist, Kazimir Malevichâ€™s quotes on painting and Suprematism genre. Inspired by the straightforward being of the shapes, lines, and colors in Suprematism, I gave each shape the motion to get together with other shapes and recreate the original piece. I created wireframes, mock-ups, and coded the website using HTML and CSS. The final deliverables were presented and critiqued in my web authoring class during the Winter of 2017.
