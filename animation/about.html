<h1 class="abouttitle"> Shapes in Motion</h1>
<p class="abouttext">
This website explores the Suprematist Artist, Kazimir Malevich’s quotes on painting and Suprematism genre. Ian Pollock, design professor at California State University, East Bay, assigned this project to sharpen our CSS animation skills. Inspired by the straightforward being of the shapes, lines, and colors in Suprematism, I gave each shape the motion to get together with other shapes and recreate the original piece. I created wireframes, mock-ups, and coded the website using HTML and CSS. The final deliverables were presented and critiqued in my web authoring class during the Winter of 2017.
