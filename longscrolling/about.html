     <p>
       I designed this website as an assignment for web authoring class at Cal State East Bay. The objective was to get more familiar with javascript and its capabilities. The website story is straight forward and short as my main goal was to focus more on the coding itself than the story. Code languages used in this story are html, css and javascript. You can see my initial collages and sketches that lead into creation of this website on this page. </p>
