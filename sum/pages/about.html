        <h2>Sum:Forty years from the afterlives</h2>
        <p>Sum:Forty years from the afterlives is a book by American writer and neuroscientist, David Eagleman. Sum includes forty short stories that tell us about innovative and unordinary afterlives that we have never heard of. This website is inspired by the first story that the book is also named after it. In this afterlife, you have to live their life again but this time in a different order. All similar tasks are grouped together. For instance, all the time you spent staring into the refrigerator or watching TV or hanging out with friends.All the time you had pain or clipped your nails. This categorized tasks although sound interesting in the beginning of the story they loose the excitement as you keep reading the story. There is no way out when you get tired of doing a task. You might be doing the same task for weeks, months or even years. Knowing what happens next and for how long is definitely boring and no one wants to live their lives in this "organized" setting. Life is precious because it's unpredictable. While the human is always trying to predict the future, this story appreciates the unpredictable aspect of life events. In my opinion, another point of life that we don't notice in everyday life and this story is trying to bring to our attention is how much time we waste every day and that we should value the time we're alive. Although the time predictions of Eagleman in Sum are just estimates, they are proof that people spend too much time on doing everyday tasks.</p>
