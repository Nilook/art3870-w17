    <p>
    April Greiman is a well-known and influential American designer. With her innovative ideas in design and transmedia projects, she builds a bridge between art and computer technology. She uses the computer in a different light and realizes its potentials as a design tool. She is known for introducing the “New Wave” design style in the US. </p>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>April Greiman was born on September 10, 1948, and was raised in New York. She attended the graphic design undergraduate program at Kansas City Art Institute from 1966-1970. In the early 70s, she enrolled herself at the Allgemeine Künstgewerberschule Basel (now the Basel School of Design). Having the supervision of Armin Hofmann and Wolfgang Weingart, she was influenced by the International Style and the style later known as “New Wave”.Some of New Wave’s design characteristics include inconsistent letterspacing, varying type weights within single words and type set at non-right angles. In 1976, she moved to Los Angeles,where she established the multi-disciplinary approach that extends into her current practice, Made in Space.</p>

    <h4>Greiman's Design Importance</h4>
    <p>While digitalization and computer technology advances during the 1970s, made most designers afraid, Greiman made use of pixelation and other digitization “errors” as integral parts of digital art. She has been instrumental in exploring and spreading the idea of involving advanced technology in the arts and design process since the early 80s.</p>

    <p>he California Institute of the Arts appointed her the head of the design department, in 1981. she lobbied successfully to change the department name to Visual Communications, as she felt the term “graphic design” is limiting to future designers. At Cal Arts, she met photographer-artist Jayme Odgers, and Odgers became an important influence. Odgers and Greiman designed a famous 1977 Cal Arts poster that was adopted as the icon of the California New Wave.</p>

    <p>In 1995, the U.S. Postal Service launched a stamp designed by Greiman to commemorate the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Women's Voting Rights). a one-woman show of her digital photography, entitled Drive-by Shooting, was held by the Pasadena Museum of California Art, in 2006. She was also recently in the group show at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, in a major exhibition Elle@Centre Pompidou. Her largest ever work, a public mural, entitled: "Hand Holding a Bowl of Rice," is a public mural spanning seven stories of two building facades marking the entrance to the Wilshire Vermont Metro Station in Los Angeles.</p>

    <p>Her invaluable contribution to graphic design had the American Institute of Graphic Arts present her with the Gold Medal for lifetime achievement.</p>
